# CaeserCypher
This program will decode a caseser cipher without it being giving the number it was shifted by.  Since E is the most commonly used letter
in the English language it finds the most letter occurences in the ciphered text then determines the key based upon this.  Of course, this
only works with certain encoded documents as short texts may not have E as the most common letter.  This was tested using a copy of the
decleration of independence which it succesfuly decoded.
